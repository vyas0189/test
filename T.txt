Hello,

I hope you are doing well. I was notified by HR regarding the offer letter for the role and I am very excited about the opportunity. I have a few questions regarding the position and would appreciate some additional information.

I know that this position will be a significant step up from my current position (601 to 603) and that there will be a learning curve. Could you please provide more details about my day-to-day responsibilities and the expectations of my role?

Thank you,

Vyas Ramankulangara
